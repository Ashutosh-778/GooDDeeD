0. How to Read This Document (Important)

If you are beginner → read top to bottom once

If you are revising → jump to sections

If you are interview-preparing → focus on WHY paragraphs

This document explains:

What you built

Why you built it this way

What problem each piece solves

What would break if it was done differently

1. Problem Statement (Expanded)
The real-world problem

Most apps fail because they model things too simply.

Your backend solves a real coordination problem:

Multiple people collaborate on causes, but
permissions, approval, and ownership must be controlled.

Examples:

Anyone can join, but not everyone should be approved

Admin of one cause should not control another cause

Goals must belong to a cause

Search should work by intent, not just names

This is not CRUD — this is business logic.

2. Architecture Overview (Deep Dive)
Why layered architecture exists

You structured your code like this:
Controller
